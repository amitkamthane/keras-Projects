**Description about DataSet**

The Avila dataset has been extracted from 800 images of the Avila Bible. The dataset consists of various features about the images of the text, such as intercolumnar distance and margins of the text. The dataset also contains a class label that indicates if the pattern of the image falls into the most frequently occurring category or not. The palaeographic analysis of the manuscript has individuated the presence of 12 copyists. The pages written by each copyist are not equally numerous. Each pattern contains 10 features and corresponds to a group of 4 consecutive rows.- The prediction task consists in associating each pattern to one of the 12 copyists (labeled as: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, W, X, Y).
